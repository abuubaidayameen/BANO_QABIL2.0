            The Snake game is a classic arcade-style game that originated in the late 1970s and gained popularity in the 1990s with the introduction of mobile phones. 
                                      The game typically involves controlling a snake on a bordered playing field,
                             with the objective being to consume food items (often depicted as dots or pellets) to grow in length.
                                  As the snake eats food, it becomes longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

Here's a basic description of the game mechanics:

Starting Position:
                The game usually begins with a single segment snake positioned in the center or a corner of the playing field.

Movement:
         The player controls the snake's direction, typically using arrow keys or swipe gestures. The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing, and the player's input changes its direction.

Food Items: 
           Food items appear randomly on the screen. These are represented by dots, pellets, or other symbols. When the snake consumes a food item, it grows longer.

Growing Length:
             As the snake eats food, its length increases. The player's score often correlates with the length of the snake or the number of food items eaten.

Collision:
         The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the playing field. This means the player must navigate the snake carefully to avoid running into its own body or the walls.
